## Causal-Inference-STAT-600

In this project, we have harvest and seeding data of a particular field for two different crops (Soybean and Corn) from year 2017 to 2020. We have seen that there are 2 years data for Soybeans Harvest (2017 and 2019), 2 years data for Corn Harvest and 2 years data for Corn Seeding Rates which were harvested over the years. Our goal is to to make causal inferences about the relationship among grain yield and seeding rate,and historical grain yields. With using pairs plot we would be able to find some meaningful patterns about higher seeding rates and yield rates or usefulness about alternative planting of corn and soybeans. In order to complete our inferences, we have to combine individual yield and seeding maps for 6 years followed by mergeing the combined data set by grid cell into a single data set for further analysis. Then we will normalize the data using ranks and then we will make pairs plot to assert a causal relationship.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64025349/147315358-36f407c4-f6a9-49ad-a83d-c1146c381027.png)
